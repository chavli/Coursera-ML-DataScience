#
# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from
# 1999â€“2008?

# pull rows from SCC that are coal combustion sources
coal_sources = SCC[grep("Fuel Comb", SCC$EI.Sector), ]
coal_sources = coal_sources[grep("Coal", coal_sources$EI.Sector), c("SCC", "EI.Sector")]

# merge with emission data and use only emissions from coal sources

emissions = filter(emissions, !is.na(Emissions))

# sum emissions by year
