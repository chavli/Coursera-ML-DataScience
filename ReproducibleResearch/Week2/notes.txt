===== R Markdown
R Code + Markdown language = knitr

slidify package: R Markdown -> Slides


===== Knitr

Reprodicible Work:
    1. keep track of everything (version control)
    2. don't save output or the results of operations. provide raw data and the code to transform it
    3. use non-proprietary formats

good for summarizing live data (if can be done quickly)

Rmd code chunk

```{r}
<code>
```


```{r graphcode}  # name code section'
<code>
```

```{r modelcode,echo=F} # hiding the code
```

```{r modelcode,echo=F,results="hide"} # hiding the code and code output
```

# embedding code within text
```{r echo=F}
time = ...
rand = ...
```
The current time is `r time`.
My favorite number is `r rand`.


# Rmd embeds the binary image data into the generated html. thus the entire document is
# self contained
```{r modelcode,fig.height=4} # control the height of embedded graphs
```

Other options

Output --
results: asis, hide
echo: True, False

Figures --
fig.height
fig.width

Caching ---
caches the results of a computation to disk. this is very good for long computations with rarely changing results
cache: True, False
