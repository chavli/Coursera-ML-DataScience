===== Conditions for ANOVA
Independence:
  - within groups: samples within groups must be independent
  - between groups: samples between groups must be independent

Approx Normal: distributions within each group should be nearly normal
  normal probability plots (sample quantiles vs theoretical quantiles)

Equal Variance: variance within each group should be nearly equal (homoscedastic)
  more important if sample sizes between groups varies greatly

Independence:
  -random sample / assignment
  - each group less than 10% of respective population
  - no-pairing between groups (use repeated measures ANOVA)
