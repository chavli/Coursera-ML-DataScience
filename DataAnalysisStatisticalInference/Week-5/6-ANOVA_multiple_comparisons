===== ANOVA multiple comparisons
determine which means are different from each other

multiple tests lead to inflated error rates.o
one test at 5% sig level has a 5% chance of making a type 1 error (reject null when true)
two tests at 5% sig level incur a larger than 5% chance of making a type 1 error

to adjust for this inflation we consider the Bonferroni Correction

bonferroni sig level = sig level / number of comparisons
  = sig level / (k * (k - 1) / 2), k = number of groups

example:
sig level 5% (.05)
number of levels (groups) within variable: k = 4

bonferroni sig level = .05 / (4 * 3 / 2) = .05 / 6 = .0083 

the adjusted sig level is much more stringent

standard error for multiple groups:

SE = sqrt( MSE/ n1 + MSE/ n2)  # given anova output
df = df_e (all groups use same error rate)

Hypothesis Test Setup:
H_0: mu_1 - mu_2 = 0
H_1: mu_1 - mu_2 != 0

T-score = ((x_1 - x_2) - 0) / SE

p-value is calculated from the T-score and df. in this case we use df = df_e 
if df is large, the t-dist will be normal-like. If the T-score is > 4, then the 
difference is significance

Using R (two-tailed):
p-value = 2 * pt(t-score, df, lower.tail=F)

compare p-value to bonferroni sig level
