===== T-Distribution
dealing with small sample sizes (<30) and CI's for means.

t-distribution
- centered at 0
- single parameter: degrees of freedom (df)
- has thicker tails which means data is more likely to be within 2 SD from the mean

as df increases the t-dist approaches the normal distribution. In general the distribution
is more conservative than the normal distribution and becomes more conservative as
df decreases.

degrees of freedom is based on data size. the less data you have the harder it becomes
to reject the null hypothesis

the t-distribution is good in scenarios when:
  - the sample size is small
  - there is no good estimate for the variance or the variane is unknown
  - the population distribution must be normal 


instead of z-statistics we look at a t-statistics (variance unknown, small sample size)
  T = (obs - null) / SE


===== Inference with T-Distribution
same idea: point estimate +/- margin of error. 

the difference are in the details: due to small sample sizes we use the t-dist

x_bar +/- t_df * SE_x

SE_x = s / sqrt(n) s = sample standard deviation

degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1

to figure out the critical t value t_df, you need to know df and corresponding tail
areas for your confidence level. tail area is total tail area (so sum of both tails 
in a two sided test).

using R (find critical values): 
>> qt(0.025, df = 21) # takes the area under the lower tail (ex two-sided 95% CI)
>> 2.08

using R (find p-value) (two sided)
>> pt(t-score, df) # returns the p-value under the lower (left) tail
>> 2 * pt(t-score, df, lower.tail = False)


===== Inference for Comparing Two Small Sample Means
In this situation we again consider the difference between the two means.
Confindence Interval:
  (x_1 - x_2) +/- t_df * SE_(x1_x2)

Hypthesis Test:
T_df  = (obs - null) / SE
      = ((x_1 - x_2) - (mu_1 - mu_2)) / SE_(x1 - x2)

SE_(x1 - x2) = sqrt( s_1^2 / n1 + s_2^2 / n2  )

the df used for multiple sample groups is:
df = min(n1 - 1, n2 -1) # conservative heruristic

t_df = critical value
T_df = T-score


Confidence Intervals and Hyp Tests must agree with each other:
H_0 not in CI <=> we reject H_0
