===== Bootstrapping
Perform estimates on statistics other than means

ex: no CLT for medians

given the original sample, we assume that the overall population will have many data
points similar to what's in the sample. we call this assumed population the 
"bootstrap population". This implies the sample is representative.

bootstrap sample - a sample of size N taken from the original sample of size N with 
  replacement

bootstrap statistics - the value computed on the bootstrap sample

repeat until you have enough samples to build a bootstrap distribution


===== Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

1) Percentile method: take the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution to estimate the
  95% CI

2) Standard Error Method: calculate the mean and standard error of the bootstrap
  distribution. Then you find the 95% CI by calculating  mean +/- 1.96 * SE

The bootstrap strategy has few assumptions but if the resulting bootstrap distribution
is skewed or sparse the resulting intervals may be unreliable. Also, the starting
sample population must be representative (random sampling)


sample distribution: created using a sample drawn from the true population with replacement

bootstrap distribution: created using a sample drawn from the original sample with replacement

the former is often difficult to do
