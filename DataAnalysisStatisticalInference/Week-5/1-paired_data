===== Hypothesis Testing For Paired Data
Dealing with two data points taken for different treatments on the same subject.
Example: the scores for two sections of a test from the same student

This is called "paired data", to make all the samples independent you calcuate the 
difference and perform analysis on the new value.

In the framework of a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference
H_0: average diff = 0
H_1: average diff != 0

Alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference. From this point, the test
is carried out as usual.

The average difference in paired values will be near-normal

Z = (x_diff - u_diff) / SE_diff

use z-score to find p-value (one sided), since hyp test is two sided, multiply the value
by two


===== Confidence Intevals for Paired Data
same idea: point_estimate +/- SE

When doing paired tests, the interpretation of the results should be stated more carefully
since you're dealing with a difference.

For example, the 95% CI for the difference in two parts of an exam is between (-1.78, .68).
This isn't useful as it doesn't tell you which section is expected to have a higher
score.

So taking the CI (-1.78, .68), and a diff calculated as part_1 - part_2 we phrase the
results as:

we are 95% confident that students will score 1.78 points lower to .69 points
higher on part 1 when compared to part 2


===== Comparing Independent Means From Two Groups
This takes a similar strategy to paired-data in where the hyp test is carried out on
the difference of values rather than the values themselves.


An example of this is comparing the means of various subgroups within a sample.
(work hours per week | education level) ~ (numeric | categorical)

A side-by-side box-plot is good for comparing numeric and categorical data together.

sample means: x_1. x_2, diff_x = x_1 - x_2

CI = diff_x +/- z*SE

SE = sqrt( s1 / n1 + s2 / n2  ) s = sample variance, n = sample sizes

Conditions for comparing means:
Independence:
  - within groups: random sample, < 10% of population
  - between groups: non-paired
  - sample size of each group must be >= 30

H_0: diff = 0
H_1:  diff != 0

z-score determines the point at which you begin calculating the area. the total 
area is called the p-value. for a two sided test, you multiply the area by 2.

always mention sample sizes in results so data are reproducible
