===== Correlation
measures the strength of the linear association between two numerical values
  cor(x, y) = cor(y, x)

  highly sensitive to outliers. the correlation coefficient can be altered a lot by a 
  single outlier.  (all points weighted equally)

  need a different metric to measure a non-linear associate between variables
