===== Dealing with Outliers
Identifying and handling outliers when performing linear regression.
We want to determine what effect the outlier has on the regression line and this can 
be done by calculating the regression with and without the outliers.

Before any of this can be done, we must first identify the outliers:
  outliers are points that fall beyond the general cluster of data points and can be 
  classified into two types:
    
    leverage points: points that fall horizontally away
    from the cloud but don't influence the regression line

    influential points: points that alter the regression line. calculate the regression
      with and without these points to see the difference in slope.

    graphing the data points is an effective way to classify outliers


In many cases, the outliers are the most interesting points and removing them would
take away crucial information. An alternative strategy is to "regroup" the orignal
data and perform a regression on each group.
