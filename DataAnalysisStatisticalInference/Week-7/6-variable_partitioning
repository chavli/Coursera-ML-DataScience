===== Variability Partitioning
Another method for determining the significance of a model is to use R^2 value.
Instead of using a t-test to perform the analysis, we look at how much of the variance
in y is explained by x (or x's).

This method is similar to ANOVA

we just run our linear model through anova and examine the values of the output.
In this case we use the F-statistic to perform the hypothesis test.

Calculating R^2:
  1. cor(x, y)^2
  2. explained variability / total variability (values come from anova table)

If the p-values in the anova table are extremely small ( large F-statistics ) 
we say the predictor is significant.
