===== Inference with Regression
Hypothesis testing for the siginificance of the predictor, CI's for the slope, and 
conditions for inference.

The question we want to answer is:
  Is the explanatory variable a significant predictor of the response variable?
  (This is a test for the slope.)

  H0: B0 = 0, no slope, no relationship between explanatory and response variables
  H1: B1 != 0, there is some relationship, slope is significant


We use the t-distribution to determine the significance of the slope
  
  t_statistic (T) = (point_estimate - null value) / SE

  T = (b1 - 0) / SE_b1, df = n - # paramters

  we lose one degree of freedom for each paramter estimate, in the single explanatory
  case df is: n - 2 

  IMPORTANT: n is the number of data points

  all this information is provided in the R output of linear regression

  p_value = P(t >= abs(T)) 


We can also calculate confidence intervals for the slope:
  b1 +/- t_df*SE_b1

t_df is the t_score of the desired confidence interval
R:
  qt(significance level / 2, df) # two tailed


NOTE: inference on the intercept is rarely performed



=== Conditions for Interence
  must be a sample, no point in doing this if we have the entire population
  samples must be independent
  samples must be randomly sampled
