==== Residuals
residuals are the differences (leftovers) between the data points and the fitted model.
residual = true response value - fitted response value = data - fit = y - y_hat



===== Least Squares Lines
Minimizing the residuals to build a best fit line is not ideal since residuals can
be positive and negative. Two alternative  and better options are:

minimize absolute values of residuals (L1)
  sum abs(y - y_hat)   
  all residuals weighted equally

minimize the squared residuals (L2)
  sum (y - y_hat)^2
  values with higher errors are weightedm more

least squares line: y = b0 + b1*x
  b1 = slope = (s_y / s_x) * R_xy
    s_y = stand dev of Y
    s_x = stand dev of X
    R_xy = corr(x, y)

    b1 tells us how much the response unit changes, on average, per unit change in 
    the explanatory variable

  b0 = y-intercept
    the best fit line always goes through the average of x and y: x_bar, y_bar
    the intercept can be calculated easily:
      b0 = y_bar - b1*x_bar

    b0 is the expected value of the response variable if the value of the explanatory
    variable is 0. sometimes this value only makes mathematical sense.


===== Prediction and Extrapolation
  prediction: lets us take unseen x-values that fall into the range of the original
  x-values and pumps out a prediction for y. 

  extrapolation is when you try to make a prediction for an x-value that falls 
  outside the range of the original data. many times, the intercept is an extrapolation.
  extrapolation also assumes that the trend seen in the original range of data
  is true for data outside the original range.
