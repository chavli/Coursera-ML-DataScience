===== significance vs confidence

for two-sided hypothesis tests the significance level and confidence level
are complements of each other.
95% confidence level = 5% significance level (alpha = .05)

alpha = .05, CI = 95%
alpha = .1, CI = 90%
CI = 1 - alph


one-sided hyp test with 5% significance (alpha = .05), this leads to a 90%
confidence interval since CI's have to be symmetric.

alpha =.05, CI = 90%
alpha = .1, CI = 80%
CI = 1 - 2 * alpha


hypothesis tests can use one or two tails but confidence levels must always be
symmetric around the mean. as a result, the CI must cut-off the other tail 
when being calculated from a one-sided hypothesis test.


if H_0 is rejected and the CI follows the hyp tesst H_0 will not be found
within the CI.

if we fail to reject H_0 and the CI agrees with the hyp test, H_0 must be
in the CI
