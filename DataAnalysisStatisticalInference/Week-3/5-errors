===== decision errors
type 1 error, type 2 errors, and balancing them

type 1 error: rejecting H_0 when H_0 is true
type 2 error: failing to reject H_0 when H_A is true

determining which error to minimize is highly dependent on the context.

in the context of a court case, it is much worse to convict an innocent person
than it is to left a guilty person walk.

===== type I error rate:
reject H_0 when p-value is less than alpha (usually a small alpha)
this makes it difficult to reject H_0

P(type I error | H_0 true) = alpha

increasing our alpha (.01, .05, .1) also increases our chance of making a 
type I error.

choosing an alpha is based on how costly making a type I error is. if 
a type I error is extremely costly, then a lower alpha is better

type 1 error rate: alpha
type 2 error rate: beta (usually dont control this)
power of a test is 1 - beta

goal: keep alpha and beta low


===== type 2 error
if the true popuation statistic is very close to the null value it is harder
to detect a difference (stating there is no difference when there actually is).
As a result of this, beta, also depends on "effect size" (delta) the
difference between the point estimate and null value.
