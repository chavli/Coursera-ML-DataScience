===== statistical vs practical signficance
statistical significance is based on z-score
practical significance is based on "effect size"

effect size is the difference between the null hypothesis value and the
alternative value. using a large enough n, a researcher can claim 
that a small difference between two values is statistically siginificant...
even if the effect size (diff between H_0 and H_A) is really small.

always ask about the effect size when dealing with significance tests
