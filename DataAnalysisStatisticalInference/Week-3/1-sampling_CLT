===== sampling and the CLT


the mean of means of subpops drawn from the total population will be about the
same as the mean of the total population

the variance (or std) of the means of the subpops will be less than the variance
of the total population. additionally, as the subpop sizes increase, the
variance of the means of the subpops will decrease.

====== Central Limit Theorem:
  the distribution of a sample statistics is nearly normal, centered at the
  population mean and with a std dev equal to the population std dev divided by
  sample size

if population std dev is not avaiable, use sample std dev

x_bar ~ N(mu, sigma / sqrt(n))


1. sampled observations must be independent
  - random sample / assignment
  - if sampling without replacement, n < 10% population

2. sample size and skew: if population dist is normal, any sample size
  will give you a normal dist

  if the population dist is skewed, larger sample sizes are needed 
  (n > 30, but more is better)

====== CLT conditions
  10% rule, sample size is never more than 10% of the total population.
  this condition attempts to prevent drawing samples where members of the
  sample have a dependencies between them.

  skewness: if the initial population is heavily skewed, a larger sample
  size will be needed to make the sample statistic follow a normal 
  distribution.


population
sample size - size of a single instance
sample count  - number of instances



the variability of sample means is measured using standard error not
standard deviation.

general idea, know where the variability/randomness is coming from and
use the standard error/deviation of the randomness
