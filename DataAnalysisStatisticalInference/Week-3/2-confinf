===== confidence interval (for means)
95% CI = x_bar +/- 2*SE #SE = standard error, margin of error

in general"
x_bar +/- z * (s / sqrn(n)), s = sample std dev


the conditions to use the above method are the same as the conditions for the CLT:
1. independence
    randomly selected/assigned
    n < 10% of total population size
2. sample size / skew

z is the critical value that determines the cut off points for the confinf
to calculate the critical value:
1. determine the strength of the CI: 90, 95, or 99%
2. since the dist is symmetrical you want to find the cutoff points on each
side that capture the middle CI.
3. percent = (1 - CI) / 2
4. look up the z-score using the percent value

R: 
qnorm(percent_val)
qnorm(.025) = +/- 1.96 # 95% CI

# 90% , z = 1.64
# 98% , z = 2.33

===== accuracy vs precision
accuracy is how often our CI captures the true population value
precision is the width of the interval

we typically begin by choosing the accuracy (CI) that we want and the
rest of the calculations flow from that.

increased accuracy = decreased precision

increasing sample size, increases precision and accuracy.

confidence interval does not describe the individual elements that make 
up the sample statistics (which the CI describes)


===== samples sizes, margin of errors, accuracy
you can begin with choosing a margin of error, and CI and then calculate the 
sample size you need to accomplish that ME

ME = z * (S / sqrt(n)) S = sample deviation

decreasing the ME requires a polynomial increase in sample size

to cut the ME in half requires 4 times as many samples
to cut the ME by 1/3 requres 9 times as many samples



===== example
a 95% confidence interval means that 95% of random samples will have a
parameter value that falls within the described range
