=== Data Basics
  Categorial: Ordinal, Categorial
  Numerican: Continuous, Discrete

=== Types of Studies
  Obserational vs Experiement

  Observational - based on random sampling, can make generalizable and correlation statements (retrospective: past data, prospective: data collected during experiment)
  Experiment - based on random assignment, can make causal statements

  Confounding Variables: factors that influence the variables of interest in an experiment (may not be known to researchers)


=== Census vs Samples
  A census is a sample containing the whole population. Additionally, the population can change while a census occurs so the result will only be an approximation
  of the true population. Sampling is cheaper and in most cases enough for analysis (if representative).


=== Sources of Bias
  0 bias = use the entire population
  bias may be introduced when selecting sample groups

  Convenience Sample: individuals who are easily accesable are more likely yo be included in the sample
    population is not random or representative

  Voluntary Response: occurs when only those who volunteer response (have strong opinions)
    population is not random

  Non-response: a small non-random non-representative of the sample population respond
    population is random, responses are not random / representative. 

  Difference between non-response and voluntary is that the former includes an initial random sample but a non-random sub-sample of people reply. In the latter
  there is no initial random sample.


  Sampling Methods
    Simple Random Sample
      Sample uniformly from the overall population

    Stratified Sample
      Divide the population into homogeneous groups and sample uniformly from the groups

    Cluster Sample
      Divide the population into heterogenous clusters and sample uniformly from a 
      random subgroup of clusters (more economical)


=== Experimental Design
  - Control: a "neutral" group used to compare the treatment of interest to
  - Randomize: randomly assign subjects to treatments
  - Replicate: have a large enough sample to perform the experiment multiple times
  - Block: control variables that are known to effect the desired results.
    Divide experiment into blocks and then randomize groups within each block

  Blocking variables are characteristics of the experimental units that we want
  to control for (similar to stratifying).

  Explanatory variables are conditions we impose on experimental units.    

  blind: the experimental units don't know if they are in the control group or not
  double-blind: the experimental units and researchers don't know who's in the control
  group and who isn't


=== Random Sampling and Random Assignment
  Random sampling allows us to make generalizable conclusions
    - method of choosing from population

  Random assignment allows us to make causal conclusions
    - method of assigning population members to experimental treatments
    - mitigate the characteristics of the experimental units on results
