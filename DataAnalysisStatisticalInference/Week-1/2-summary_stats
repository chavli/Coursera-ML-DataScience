=== Summary Statistics
  Evaluation Relationships:
    Direction, Shape, Strength, Outliers

  Scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, dotplot, xintensity map

Skewness - distributions are skewed towards the longer tail
Modaility - the number of peaks (modes)

=== Measure of Center
  mean - arithmatic average
  median - 50th percentile
  mode - most frequent value (not very useful for continuous variables)

  mean < median in left-skewed distributions
  mean > median in right-skewed distributions

=== Measure of Spread
  range - (max - min)

  IQR - difference between 25th and 75th percentile

  variance - average squared deviation from the mean
    squaring values removes the effects of negative numbers on positve numbers
    larger deviations have more influence on the variance

  standard deviation - square of the variance

  diversity vs variability: diversity measures how evenly distributed the values
  between some range are.

  10, 10, 10 50, 50 has more variability than 10, 20, 30, 40, 50


=== Robust Statistics
  statistics that are not effected significantly by extreme observations

  robust, non-robust
  median  mean
  IQR     StDev, range

  robust statistics should be used for skewed distributions

=== data transformations
  -skewed data is often transformed to be more symmetric
  -data that is positive and right-skewed can be log-transformed to be more 
  symmetrical

  other transforms:
  square root
  inverse


=== categorical variables
  the bars of a barplot can be presented in any order, unlike a histogram where
  the bars follow a natural ordering.

  contingency variable: model the distribution between multiple categorical variables
  segmentend bar graph

  relative frequency segmented bar plot

  mosaic plot, can show 3 variables at once in a 2d graph
  e.g.
  width of each bar represents sample size
  height of each bar within its category shows its relative frequence
  colors within a category represent another category condtioned on the first category
