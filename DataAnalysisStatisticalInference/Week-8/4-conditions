===== Diagnostics for Multiple Regression

Conditions:
  linear relationship between numerical X's and Y
    can be checked by looking for a random scatter in the residual plot (e vs x)
      plot(model$residuals, X)

  nearly normal residuals
    checked using a histogram and qqplots
    hist(model$residuals), qqnorm(model$residuals), qqline(model$residuals)

  constant variability of residuals centered around 0
    plot(model$residuals, model$fitted), plot(abs(model$residuals), model$fitted)

  indepedence of residuals
    => independence of observations
    if data is a time-series, check residiuals vs ordered data
