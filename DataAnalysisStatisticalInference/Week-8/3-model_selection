===== Model Selection
The process of choosing variables for building a model.

Stepwise Methods:
  backwards elimination: start with a full model and remove variables
  forward selection: start with an empty model and add variables

the criteria for removing and adding variables are:
  p-values and adjusted R^2
  AIC, BIC, DIC (difference information criterion), Bayes factor

=== Backwards Elimination (using R^2)
  1. start with all variables
  2. remove one variables at a time and remember adjusted R^2
  3. pick the model with highest R^2
  4. repeat steps 2-4 until R^2 stops increasing by some epsilon

=== Backwards Elimination using p-values
  1. start with the full model
  2. drop the variable with the highest p-value, refit smaller model
  3. repeat until all variables are significant

R^2 does not have to refit since the variability explained by each variable
will not change (total variability is constant). 

The tricky situation arises with categorical values with each level having a reported
p-value. Levels of a categorical variable cant be dropped, so the only way to drop
a categorical variable is if all it's levels are not-significant. 


The difference in the above methods:
p-value: significant predictors, based on somewhat arbitrary sig level
  the advantage is that this requires fewer models to be calculated in each iteration.
  (build once, eliminate once)

adjusted R^2: more reliable predictors
  the disadvantage is that many models have to be built per iteration in the worst case. 
  (build one model with one variable removed, eliminate one variable)


=== Forward Selection (adjusted R^2)
  1. start with no variables
  2. create models where each has a different additional variable added
  3. choose the model with highest R^2
  4. repeat steps 2-4 until adjusted R^2 stops increasing

=== Forward Selection (p-values)
  1. start with no variables
  2. create models where each has a different additional variable added
  3. choose the model with the lowest significant p-value for the new variable
  4. repeat steps 2-4


=== Expert Opinion
In some cases it is best to choose variables based on the expertise of someone 
in the related domain.



=== Final Model
If using the adjusted R^2 approach it is not guaranteed that all the variables in the 
final variable will be statistically significant. It is guaranteed that the chosen
variables all contribute to the predictive power of the model.
