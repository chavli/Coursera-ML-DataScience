===== Inference for Multiple Regression
Determining which variables are siginificant predictors by building CI's and
performing Hyp Tests.

The first step in determining which variables are the best is to build a model with
all variables.

We then perform inference on the model as a whole:
H0: all slopes are 0
H1: at least one slope is non-zero

We use the F-statistics where DF = n - k - 1, k = 4.

=== IMPORTANT
Rejecting H0 means the model as a whole is significant, it doesn't mean the model
fits the data. (it really means just one parameter is not 0)

Failing to reject H0 means the model as a whole is not significant, it doesn't mean
the individual variables are not good predictors of y


If the overall model is significant, then the next step is to find out which variables
make it significant. In R, this can be determined by looking at the p-values
in the output of the linear model summary.

Determining it by hand is done using a hypothesis test and the t-statistic.

B is the slope of the variable of interest

H0: B = 0
H1: B != 0

T = (point estimate - null value) / SE = (B - 0) / SE_B. All these values come 
from the summary output of the linear model. df = n - k - 1



------
use pX functions to calculate p_values from statistic 
use qX functions to calculate the crutucal values used in determining the CI

be extremely cautious over the sidedness of the test as the effect the above two 
calculations.s
