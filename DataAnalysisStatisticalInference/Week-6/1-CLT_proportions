===== Sampling Variability and the CLT for proportions
sample distribution: collection of samples
sampling distribution: collection of sample statistics based on samples

proportions are usually applied to categorical variables to make them numerical.

question: smoker or non-smoker (binary, categorical)
results: 54% (numeric)

--- CLT for proportions:
p_hat: center of sample distribution
p: center of population distribution

p_hat ~ Normal(mean = p, SE = sqrt((p * (1 - p)) / n))

--- CLT Conditions
  1. Indepdence
    random sample / assignment
    sampling without replacement: n < 10% of total population
  2. Sample size / skew: for binary categorical variables, at least 10 successes and 10 failures
    n*p >= 10, n*(1-p) >= 10

  If p is unknown use p_hat and hope it's accurate (sample is representative)  

  Example:
  p = .9
  n = 200

  P(p_hat > .95) = ? 

  p_hat ~ Normal(.90, .0212), Z-score = (.095 - .9) / .0212 = 2.36
  P(p_hat > .95) = P(Z > 2.36) = .0091


In the case of binary categorical variables, the binomial distribution can also be used.
n = 200, p = .9, 95% successes = 200 * .95 = 190

Using R:
sum(dbinom(190:200), 200, .90)


----- breaking requirements
if the success-failure requirement is not met:
  + the sampling distribution will still be centered around the true population proportion
  + the spread can still be approximated by the usual SE calculation
  - however, the shape of the distribution will depend on whether p is close to 0 or 1
