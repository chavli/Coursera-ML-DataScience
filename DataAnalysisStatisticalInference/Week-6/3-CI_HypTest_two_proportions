===== Confidence Intervals for Two Proportions
the strategy is the same as when comparing two means: when comparing two propotions we 
focus on the difference of the two values rather than the values themselves:

CI: p_hat1 - p_hat2 +/- Z * SE_(p_hat1 - p_hat2)

SE = sqrt( (p_hat1 * (1 - p_hat1)) / n1 + (p_hat2 * (1 - p_hat2)) / n2 )

note: the addition is due to the increased variance due to additional variables:
  var(a + b) = var(a) + bar(b), take the sqrt to get standard error

Independence: within group, and between groups
Success-Failure Condition: both groups must pass

===== Hypothesis Test for Two Proportions
When comparing two proportions in a hyp test, we bump into the following situation:

H_0: p1 = p2, or p1  - p2 = 0

In this scenario, we have no hard number for either proportion. This makes it difficult
to do calculations. The best we can do is make an educated guess about what the value
could be.

Pooled Proportion (weighted average): total successes / total n

p_hat_pool = (successes_1 + successes_2) / (n1 + n2)

The pooled proportion is used to calculate the success-failure condition and standard error.
note: wherever there is a p1 or p2 replace it with p_pooled

success-failure condition
  n1 * p_pool >= 10
  n1 * (1 - p_pool) >= 10
    
  n2 * p_pool >= 10
  n2 * (1 - p_pool) >= 10

standard error

  SE = sqrt(  p_pool * (1 - p_pool) / n1 + p_pool * (1 - p_pool) / n2 )

Z-score = (observed_diff - 0 / SE)

p_value = pnorm(z_score)
