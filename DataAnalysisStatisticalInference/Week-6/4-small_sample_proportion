===== Proportions Based on Small Sample Sizes
In this case we will deal with a single proportion.

Small samples tend to break the "success-failure" condition and therefore we cannot 
assume a near-normal distribution of p_hat (sample proportion).

The answer to this problem is simulation!

essentially run a large number of instances given the null value of p to build a sampling
distribution. once the sampling distribution is built, find the p_value for p_hat given
the distribution generated by the null hypothesis.

things to note:
  the value of p under the null hypothesis
  the number of trials per simulation
  the observed value p_hat


===== Comparing Two Small Mean Proportions
In this scenario, all groups fail the success-failure condition

The setup for the hypothesis test is:

H_0: p1 - p2 = 0
H_1: p1 - p2 != 0

Again, we use simulation to build each group and calculate one difference. After 
a large number of simulations we can build a sampling disitribution of differences
under the null hypothesis. We then find the p_value of the observed difference given
the sampling distribution.
