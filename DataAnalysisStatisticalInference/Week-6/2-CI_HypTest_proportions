===== Confidence Intervals for Proportions
the same methodology is used for proportions as is used by means

point-estimate +/- margin of error: p_hat +/- z * SE

SE = sqrt((p*(1-p)) / n), we don't know p most of the time so we use p_hat instead:

  SE = sqrt( (p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n )


when calculating the needed sample size to achieve a certain ME and there is no good prior
guess for the value of p, or p_hat, the best choice is p_hat = .5. This is the naive prior
and happens to provide the most conservative estimate for sample size.


===== Hypothesis Test for Proportions
the same methodoly is used for proportion hypothesis tests as well

In all calculations used to build the hypothesis test, the null value of p is used 
in place of the point-estimate. remember, in a hyp test the null hypothesis is assumed
to be true. ex. observed successes becomes expected successes

Z = (p_hat - p) / SE, SE = sqrt((p * (1 - p)) / n)

when to use p_hat vs p:

                                   conf inf            hyp test
1. success-failure condition         p_hat                 p

2. standard error                    p-hat                 p




summary:
success failure condition: n * p >= 10, n * (1 - p) >= 10
standard error:  sqrt( (p * (1 - p)) / n)
