===== Chi Square "goodness of fit" (GOF) Test
Evaulate the distribution of a categorical variable with more than 2 levels to a 
theoretical "ideal"/"expected" distribution.

"How well does the observed distribution fit the expected distribution?""

H_0: there is no difference
H_1: something is going on

Conditions for chi-squared test:
  Independence:
    random sampling / assignment
    if sampling without replacement, sample size < 10% of total population
    all groups are mutually exclusive of each other --> no samples belong to more 
    than 1 group.
  Sample size:
    each group must have at least 5 expected cases


---  Count-Data stastistic
When comparing counts, we use the chi-square (X^2) statistic.

X^2 = sum_i^k (O_i - E_i)^2 / E_i

k = number of groups (levels) 
O_i: observed count for group i
E_i: expected count for group i

The chi-squared distribution has one parameter: degrees of freedom (df)
df = # of groups - 1 = k - 1

the df influences the shape, spread, and center of the distribution.

The chi-squred distribution is always positive and is right skewed.

the p_value used in this test is dependent on the chi-squared value and df and is defined
as the area above the test statistics.

note: this is similar to the f-distribution.

Using R:
p_value = pchisq(chi_square, df, lower.tail=F)
pchisq(22.63, 4, lower.tail=F)
