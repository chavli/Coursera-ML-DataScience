==== independence

two events are independent if knowing the outcome of one provides no information
about the outcome of the other.

independent: coin flips, drawing cards with replacement
dependent: drawing cards, without replacement, from a deck

P(A | B) = P(A) //knowing something about B does not help us with A


According to a 2013 Pew Research Poll that surveyed 1,504 Americans, 
67% of respondents said that they believe the Earth is warming. 
Roughly 50% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats, and 62% of Independents 
share this opinion. Based on these data, opinion on global warming and 
political leaning are most likely

P(warming) = 67%
P(warming | republican) = 50%
P(warming | democrat) = 88%
P(warming | independent) = 62%

In this case, we see that knowing an individuals party affiliation gives
us some information about their stance of global warming. As a result, 
we say that party affiliation and global warming stance are dependent.

When we see differences, the next step is to perform hypothesis to determine
if the differences are real or caused by chance.

Determine dependence -> Perform hypothesis testing

if events are indepedent, their joint probability is:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
