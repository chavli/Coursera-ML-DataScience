===== binomial distribution

bernoulli random variable: a random variable with only two possible outcomes

the binomial distribtions models the probability of k-successes among n bernoulli
variables with probability of success p

number of scenarios * probability of a single scenario
(n choose k) * (p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k))

R: chose(n, k)

P(k successes in n trials with p rate of success) = (n choose k) * (p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k))

to be binomial:
- the trials have to be independent
- the number of trials must be fixed
- each trial has two outcomes: success or failure
- the probability of success, p, must be the same for all trials


the expected value of a binomial distribution is: E[mu] = n*p
the standard deviation is: sigma = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))

R, dbinom(k, n, possible)


===== normal approximation of the binomial
  as n -> inf, binomial -> normal

  this property lets us easily calculate statements like P(k >= m) when 
  dealing with binomial distributions using a normal distribution.

  using a strictly binomial approach P(k >= m) = sum(i)_m^n P(i successes)
    R: sum(dbinom(m:n, n, p))

  using a normal approximation, calculating P(k >= m) is much easier
    R: dnorm(m, mu, sd)

  the normal approximation requires large n and at the very least satisfy:
    n * p >= 10
    n * (1 - p) >= 10

  also the .5 adjustment of binomial values when using the normal approx


===== working with the binomial
binomial probabilities do not scale:
  it is much harder to get 600 successes of 1000 than it is to get 6 succeses
  out of 10 with a constant p.

  this is due to the larger difference in expected value and desired value.
