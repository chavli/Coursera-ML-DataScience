==== disjoint events + general addition rule

disjoint events can't occur at the same time, but you can ask for the probability
of a -union- of disjoint events:

what is the probability of drawing an ACE and a JACK ?
P(J and A)

union of non-disjoint events are when you have a joint probability
where both events have some overlap

what is the probability of drawing a RED card or a JACK? (joint events)
P(J or R) = P(J) + P(R) - P(J or R)

what is the probability of drawing a JACK or a 4? (disjoint events)
P(J or 4) = P(J) + P(3)


P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) --> non-disjoint
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)  --> disjoin events, P(A and B) = 0



sample space: the collection of all possible outcomes of a trial
  sample space of two coins: {HH, TT, HT, TH}
probabillity distribution: the rate each event in the sample space is expected
    to occur
  probability distribution of two coins {.25, .25, .25, .25}

The events must be disjoint, each have a probability 0 <= x <= 1, and sum to 1


complementary events: two disjoint (mutex) events, or set of events, whose 
  prob add up to 1

the sum of probabilities of two disjoint events does not necesarily have to be 1
the sum of probabilities of two complimentary events must be 1

complimenary events are also disjoint events.
disjoint events aren't necessarily complimentary events
