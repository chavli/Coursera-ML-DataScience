===== the normal distribution
  heights / weights are normally distributed
  SAT scores

  68% falls withing mu +/- 1sd
  95% falls within mu +/- 2sd
  99.7% falls within mu +/- 3sd

  Z-score: number of sd's a value is from the mean (standardized score)

  Z = (observation - mean)  / sd

  |Z| > 2 are considered unusual

  If you know the mean, sd, and percentile (instead of observation), you can 
  still solve for the Z score. 


  ===== evaluating a normal distribution
histogram: pretty obvious
scatterplot: y-axis are the values, x-axis are the theoretical quantiles of
  the normal distribution. if there is a 1 to 1 relationship (linear) then
  the data is normally distributed.

  if the data is right skewed (side with the tail) the scatterplot will tend
  up and to the left of the 1-1 line

  if left skewed the line plateus to the right of the line

  skinner (short tails) than normal distributions will have a S shape scatterplot along the
  1-1 line. fatter (long tails) will have points that start under the line, then 
  lie on the line, and end above the line


===== working with the normal
baggage weights: 45 pounds, sd = 3.2 pounds
pnorm - find the percentile of a given value a
qnorm - find the value of a given percentile
