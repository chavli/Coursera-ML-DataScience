===== disjoint vs independence 

disjoint events: events that cannot happen at the same time
  P(A and B) = 0

indpendent events: events where knowing about one does not tell us anything about the other
  P(A | B) = P(A)


===== condtional probability
marginal probability 

joint probability: P(A and B)

conditional probability P(A | B)

Bayes Theorem: P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

  independent events: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
  dependent events (and general rule): P(A and B) = P(A | B) * P(B)




===== Probability Trees
  just a way to organize probabilities other than a table.
