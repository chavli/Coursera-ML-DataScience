Introduction
  Loans are one method for individuals and groups to get a sudden influx of cash to use
  for whatever reason. Typically when considering a loan, the point that most people will
  dwell on the most is the interest rate. The interest rate defines how much more a
  person must pay back on top of their loan amount. Naturally, any person or organization
  would want the lowest interest rate possible. Many variables effect the interest rate with
  the most common variable being credit score, or FICO score . The purpose of this
  assignment is to examine some possible reasons for why interests rates still vary between
  people with similar FICO scores. Our initial assumption is that interest rates assigned
  to people and groups are not fixed for a given FICO score, or FICO score range. 

Methods 
  Data Collection / Dataset
   For this analysis I used a dataset provided by the Lending Club , a peer-to-peer lending 
   service, to help us in our investigation. The dataset contains 2500 loan instances (samples) and contains information about credit scores, home ownership, and employment history.

   The download time of the dataset is unknown as it was provided to us by the instructor.

   All work done on the data was performed using the R environment.


Analysis
  Exploratory Analysis
  The first step of the investigation was scrubbing the data to remove samples that were incomplete
  and/or appeared to be outliers. Only a handful of samples were missing data, however, many 
  samples listed "n/a" for employment length. This is a valid response but is useless for analysis
  so it was removed as well. Additionally, there were a few rows that listed a 
  negative value for received money. This is clearly nonsense, so these rows were also removed.
  In the end, the scrubbed dataset contained 2419 samples.

  Another important change was to increase the FICO ranges that were used to split the dataset. 
  In my case, I created a new partitionining defined by FICO ranges spanning 20 points instead of
  4. The main reason for doing this was to create subsets with larger sample sizes for statistical
  analysis.

Statistical Modelling 
  Since the objective is to discover what factors influence different interest rates to manifest 
  amongst groups with similar credit scores, the approach I took was too look for strong 
  correlations, negative and positive, beween each continuous variable, X, with interest rates 
  given a FICO range. Essentially, a conditional correlation:
  
            l = cor(X, Interest Rate) | FICO Range

  As for categorical variables, my goal was to extract the most discriminative variables. In other
  words, to find the categorical variables that divide the interest rates, given a FICO range,
  into clusters with means (or any measure) that are statistically significant. Since interests
  rates are percentages, I made the assumption that they are normally distributed. This simplifies
  the process of calculating confidence intervals.

Results
  4 FICO score ranges were chosen to perform the analysis on as they encompassed 1969 of the 2419 
  samples, about 80% of the given data. The ranges were 664-684, 684-704, 704-724, and 724,744 with
  sample sizes of 586, 568, 456, and 359 respectively. The samples contained all the provided
  original information (14 variables) and none contained missing data or suspicious looking data.

  A correlation matrix was built to analyze the relationships between interest rates and the 8
  continuous variables: "Amount Requested", "Loan Time", "Debt-to-Income Ratio", "Monthly Income", 
  "Open Credit Lines", "Revolving Credit Balance", "Number of Inquiries", and "Percentage 
  Satisfied". The last variable is simply the invested amount divided by the request amount for 
  the loan

  The resulting correlation matrices for each of the FICO ranges showed only two of the variables
  contained a strong, abs( cor(X, Y) ) >= .5, correlation with interest rate across all groups. 
  The two variables were "Amount Requested" and "Loan Time" their correlation values are listed 
  below:
