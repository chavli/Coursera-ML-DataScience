Count Predictions

Examples:
  - calls to a call center
  - number of flu cases
  - number of cars that cross a bridge
  - percent of children passing a test (rates)
  - percent of hits to a website from a country (rates)

Linear Regression with a transform is one option.

The poisson distribution is best for counts and rates
rpois(100, lambda=100) where lambda defines the rate "100 X per Unit"

One important characteristic is that the mean and variance are the same.

Poisson Regression / Log-Linear

log(E[Y|params]) = b0 + b1X 
E[Y|params] = exp(b0 + b1X) = exp(b0) * exp(b1X)

pois_fit = glm(Y ~ X, family = "poisson")
