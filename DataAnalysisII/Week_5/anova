-- ANOVA with multiple factors

outcome variable is quantitative and symmetrically distributed with multiple covariates
and you want to identify the contribution of each covariate.

Ex. AB Testing

ANOVA testing is done using aov(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3...)
--> multiple variables with multiple levels


aov_results = aov(Y ~ X + ...)
summary(aov_results)

NOTE: order of variabes matter!!! the F values displayed by summary are for all
variables are conditioned on the variables that were listed before it

aov(movies$score ~ movies$genre + movies$ratings)
not the same as
aov(movies$score ~ movies$ratings + movies$genre )

Working with quantitative values:
  factor values need a regression variable for each factor
  qualitative values only need a single variable

Y = b + b1 * I(X1 = x1) + b2 * I(X1 = x2) + ... + g1(X2)
X1 = categorical, X2 = continuous

continuous variables have 1 degree of freedom, categorical variables of one DOF
per category

terminology
unit - one observation
treatment - conditions applied to units
factors - conditions controlled by experimenter, usually technical and not of any
          interest
replicates -  multiple independent units with the same factors/treatments
