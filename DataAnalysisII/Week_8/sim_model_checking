===== Simulation for Model Checking

Simulation is good fore:
  bootstrapping a statistics
  evaluating models
  testing different hypothesis
  sensitivity analysis


Y_i = b_0 + b_1*X_i + e_i, if X_i and e_i are normal then we simulate data
by doing

b_0 = 1
b_1 = 2
X_i = rnorm(500)
e_i = rnorm(500)
Y_i = b_0 + b_1*X_i + e_i

Violating the normality assumption on either X or e will cause problems when
fitting a model.

Additionally, performing multiple simulations (above code in a loop) we can
calculuate the variance / quantiles of the parameters.


--- Simulating from a density estimate
d = density(data$X)
new_X = rnorm(N, mean=data$X, sd=d$bw) # multiple normal dists, bw=bandwidth
new_d = density(new_X, bw=d$bw)

(assuming a KDE with a gaussian kernel)
