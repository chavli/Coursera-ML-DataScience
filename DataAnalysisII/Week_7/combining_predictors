===== Combining Predictors

Classification based on averaging / voting. Improves accuracy, reduces 
interpretability.

Suppose we have 5 completely independent classifies with 70% accuracy each
 and we perform a majority vote in the end to determine classification.

Majority Vote: 5, 4, or, 3 are correct:
group_acc = 5c2 * (.7)^3 * (.3)^2 + 5c1 * (.7)^4 * (.3)^1 + (.7)^5
          = 83.7%

With 101 models group_acc = 99.9%


Methods: bagging, boosting, other combination methods
