===== The Bootstrap
Treat the sample as if it were the population. Draw sub-groups from the
sample numerous times and use each sample to calculate the target statistic.

library(boot)

boot(data, statistic, R)

Example I
data = rnorm(100)
meanFunc = function(x, i){ mean(x[i])}
bootMean = boot(data, meanFunc, 1000)


Example II
func = function(data, indices, formula){
  d = data[indices, ]
  lin_fit = lm(formula, data=d)
  return(coef(lin_fit))
}

results = boot(data=dataset, statistic = func,R = 1000, formula=log(cost) ~ date)
boot.ci(results)


- Hypothesis Testing a Model
- Non-Linear statistics (e.x. median)


- Do not bootstrap the following: max,min. these will be biased by the
  initial sample size
