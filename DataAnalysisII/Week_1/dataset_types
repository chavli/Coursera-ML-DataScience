dataset types:

census: used for descriptive analysis. typically contains the entire population, no
  generalization required.

observational study: used for inferential analysis

convenience sample: all types, but may be biased. bias can come in many forms and my 
  not seem at first to effect the outcomes or even be related to the problem.

randomized trial: establish causal relationships. randomize sample groups, one is
  typically a control group, to establish a causal relationship between variables.

retrospective: inferential tasks, looking backwards

predictive studies

across time:
  cross-sectional - inferential
  longitudinal - inferential, predictive




1. The IP address and the user ID are qualitative variables and the number of bytes returned is quantitative. 

2. Both the spread and the center increase. 

3.  82.40639

4. 0.8084719, -1.1122863, 0.3716671

5. This is an example of an inferential data analysis


7. 1. Each variable forms a column, 2. Each observation forms a row, 3. Each table/file stores data about one kind of observation. 

8. All of the above

9 We are referring to the random variable X when we know the random variable Y has value y. The distribution of this variable may be different than the distribution of the variable X when Y is also random.

10 If we took a census of all people in Baltimore, we would expect to see that the younger a person was, the more likely they were to have taken a Coursera course.
