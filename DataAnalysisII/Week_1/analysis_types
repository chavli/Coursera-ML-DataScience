analysis types:

1. descriptive - describe a set of data. not meant to suggest, predict, or infer anything

2. exploratory - discover new correlations and planning future studies. nothing here should
  be generalized or be called final.

3. inferential - use a small sample of data to say something about a larger population
  estimate the quantity you care about and the amount of uncertainty

4. predictive - use the data about some entity to predict values for another entity
  prediction != causation

5. causal - usually a randomized study. uncover what happens to one variable when another
  variable is forced to change. considered to be causal in the average case

6. mechanistic - understand the exact changes in variables that change the value of another
  variable in a predictable way. typically occurs in applied sciences and engineering.
