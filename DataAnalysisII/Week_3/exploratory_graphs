Exploratory Graphs Pt 1:
- understand data properties
- find patterns
- suggest statistical strategies
- many should be made

when displaying data, it is better to use position rather than length for comparisons.
both are better than using area or angle.

boxplot(A ~ B, col = c("blue", "orange"), names=c("yes", "no"), varwidth=T)
shows a box plot of A given each value of B
varwidth adjusts the width of each boxplot based on the number of datapoints for
each variable.

other graphs:
barplots(), hist(A, breaks=N)

density graph
density(A) -- shape is similar to a histogram but the curve sums to 1
plot(dens, lwd=3, col="blue")
lines(dens2, lwd=3,col="orange") -- overlay lines

=====

Exploratory Graphs Pt 2:
scatterplots:
plot(x, y, type, xlab, ylab, xlim, ylim, cex, col, bg)
  plot(X, Y, pch=19, col="blue")
 
 NOTE: col can be set to an explicit color or pass it a factor


-- make the size of the points dependent on the data
plot(X, Y, pch=19, col="blue", cex=X$a)


smoothScatter (X, Y),a 2D density plot
hexbin() {hexbin}, 

-- quantiles of x compared to the quantiles of y
-- if the distribution of values is the same, the points will
-- fall on a 45 deg line. compare observations with a normally distributed
-- variabled to see if the variable is normal
qqplot(x, y) 

-- handling geographic data
library(maps)
map("world") # "us", "europe", etc

lines(), points(), can be used to add more elements to a graph


library(Hmisc)
  cut2(), discretizes a continuous variable
