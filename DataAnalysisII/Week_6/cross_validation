===== Cross Validation

Accuracy on the training set is optimistic (due to overfitting)

Create prediction function using training data.

Evaluate prediction function using an independent test set

This will reduce the bias of the model

Sampling Techniques:
  Random Sampling with or without replacement
  Equal division (k-fold) - more bias but accuracy is more stable
  Leave One Out - much less bias, but more variability in accuracy

Both sets are independent but must be sampled from the same population. The
sampling method must also be uniform across sets.

When dealing with time-series data, a sample must sample a time-chunk that 
mimics real patterns.
