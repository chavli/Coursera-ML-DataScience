--- Steps in Data Analysis PT 1

1. define the question
    "Can I use quantitative characteristics of emails to classify them as 
    spam/ham"

2. define the ideal dataset
    decscriptive -  a whole population
    exploratory - a random sample with many variables measured
    inferential - the right population, randomly sampled
    predictive - a training and test set drawn from the same population
    causal - data froma randomized study
    mechanistic - data about all components in a system

3. determine what data can actually be collected / acquired

4. obtain the data
    UCI machine learning datasets

5. clean the data
    record all steps in the cleaning process

6. exploratory data Analysis
    summarize data
    clean data
    exploratory plots / exploratory statistics (clustering / dendographs / )


7. prediction / modelling 
    reduce prediction error
    confusion matrix
    measure uncertainty, and variability of uncertainty


8. intepret results (wording)
    "describes"
    "correlated/associated with"
    "predicts"
    "leads to / causes"

9. challenge results 
    initial question
    data source
    pre-processing
    analysis
    conclusions

10. write up
    lead with question
    describe the process
    interpret the results
    challenge the results

11. reproducible
