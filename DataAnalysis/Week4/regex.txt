^xxxx : matches xxxx at the START of lines

xxxx$ : matches xxxx at the END of lines

[Bb]  : character classes, match with anything that is in the class

Example:
  ^[Ii] am  : matches "I am" and "i am" at the start of lines
  ^[0-9][a-zA-z] : matches any number followed by any letter at the start of lines

[^xxxx] : negation. match lines WITHOUT the characters in the class

Example:
  [^?.]$  : match sentences that DONT end with a "?" or "."

xxxx|yyyy|zzzz : define word alternatives

Example:
  ^[Gg]ood|[Bb]ad : matches the word "good" at the start or the word "bad" anywhere
  ^([Gg]ood | [Bb]ad)


* : repeat the preceding characters match any number of times (including 0)
+ : repeat the preceding characters  match at least once
{min, max} : match the preceding characters at least min times and at most max times
{min} : match exactly min times
{min, } : match at least min times

Example:
  [Bb]ush( +[^ ]+ +){1, 5} debate - match lines with 1 to 5 words between the words "Bush"
  and "debate"

Example (repeated words):
    +([a-zA-Z]+) +\1 +
    the () matches one or more characters surrounded by a space. the \1 means to use
    the stuff in the () again to match the same word. this finds sequential
    repeated words


* is greedy, it matches any characters as possible. a "*" followed by a "?" causes
it to become lazy

Example:
  ^s(.*)s : finds the longest string that starts and end with "s"
  ^s(.*?)s : finds the first string that stars and ends with "s"
